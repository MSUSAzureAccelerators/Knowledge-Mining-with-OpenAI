The original Princeton implementation used punched cards and the EBCDIC character set. To allow INTERCAL to run on computers using ASCII, substitutions for two characters had to be made: $ substituted for \u00a2 as the mingle operator, \"represent[ing] the increasing cost of software in relation to hardware\", and ? was substituted for \u22bb as the unary exclusive-or operator to \"correctly express the average person's reaction on first encountering exclusive-or\".[5] In recent versions of C-INTERCAL, the older operators are supported as alternatives; INTERCAL programs may now be encoded in ASCII, Latin-1, or UTF-8.[6]. C-INTERCAL swaps the major and minor version numbers, compared to tradition.\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=INTERCAL\n\nContent: Negative testing is a method of testing an application or system that ensures that the plot of the application is according to the requirements and can handle the unwanted input and user behavior.[1] Invalid data is inserted to compare the output against the given input. Negative testing is also known as failure testing or error path testing. When performing negative testing exceptions are expected. This shows that the application is able to handle improper user behavior. Users input values that do not work in the system to test its ability to handle incorrect values or system failure.. Negative testing is done to check that the product deals properly with the circumstance for which it is not programmed. The fundamental aim of this testing is to check how bad data is taken care of by the systems, and appropriate errors are shown to the client when bad data is entered. Both positive and negative testing play an important role. Positive testing ensures that the application does what it is implied for and performs each function as expected. Negative testing is opposite of positive testing.\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Negative testing"
