2 Do not submit a network case for low upload throughput in scenarios where the customer is receiving low throughput while simultaneously using voice and data. Network cases for failed connections and timeouts are valid after performing appropriate troubleshooting.
Heads Up: Speeds may vary based on network congestion type and device technical specifications.

When measuring throughput, 1000 Kilobits (kb) equals 1 Megabit (Mb). Data billing is calculated as 1024 Kilobytes (KB) equals 1 Megabyte (MB).

Testing Throughput

Use one of these methods to determine the throughput the customer is receiving.

Preferred method: www.speedtest.net or the speedtest.net app
Alternate method: www.speakeasy.net/speedtest

BlackBerry
The BlackBerry handheld is capable of supporting the use of multiple APNs at the same time, and testing an accurate throughput is not always possible. 
Customers can download and install third-party applications from BlackBerry App World that provide an Internet speed test.

Signal Strength
3G/4G: Throughput speeds are not impacted by available signal strength. Low signal strength on the networks results in disconnects, lost packets, and higher latency, which may appear to the customer as slow throughput. Troubleshoot low signal strength accordingly.

•	Customers enrolled on grandfathered or expired plans may retain them, unless it is restricted on the customer's profile.
o	Revenue Assurance can only add the plan, or the ordering system does not allow it.
•	If the CTNs are on a shared plan (for example, Mobile Share, FamilyTalk, BusinessTalk), move the CTN to an individual plan before completing the move.
o	Ensure the appropriate data plan and optional messaging feature is added.
•	Prior to cancelling lines from an account with BAN-level plans/features, expire the BAN-level plan/features effective with today's date. This ensures the BAN auto-cancels itself.
•	Use transfer code CTN when:
o	Consolidating individual subscriber accounts into 1 main account, if the number of accounts/CTNs is greater than 50.
o	Performing an account split or consolidation in which the previous account(s) have 0 subscribers. This will prevent the system from automatically issuing a refund check for balances of $150 or less.

OPUS automatically factors in the customer's equipment discount, unless the Offer Element in ROME is flagged as manual intervention. If flagged for manual intervention, review FaST for profile pricing and manually discount the price.

Profile equipment discounts: These discounts are always taken off the National Contract Reference Price (NCRP), also known as the no-commitment price:
Profiles may also contain equipment-specific pricing that is not eligible for percentage-off or dollar-off discounts.
Custom Pricing Requests: Sales submits as a ROME change request. Individual Case Basis (ICB) reviews the case. If approved, the price is noted in the profile:
The profile must reflect custom pricing before applying it to the order.
All CRU customers with a FAN are eligible for contract pricing as long as they are enrolled onto an eligible CRU FAN (AMB, etc.).
SB CRU/Non-FAN customers are eligible for Next only or non-commitment pricing.
When quoting equipment prices under approved circumstances as identified in the Equipment Price Quotes section above, compare the equipment grid price to the customer's profile price (if applicable) and provide the better price of the two.

Reminders:
Consider any eligible rebates, promotions, or profile-equipment discounts when determining the equipment grid price:
Rebates, promotions, and profile-equipment discounts cannot be combined.
Profile-equipment discounts (percentage-off discounts and dollar-off discounts) are always taken off the NCRP.
If equipment is discounted to $0, the customer may be required to pay taxes based on the CTN's primary place of usage (PPU) address.

10338,Why is a customer receiving DUCs notifications while in Mexico and they have the correct plan?,"Some rate plans and international features that use Roam Like Home functionality are not being recognized by Enabler (data rating system), causing data outside the U.S. to be flagged as pay-per-use (PPU). This is triggering Data usage Control System (DUCs) usage notifications (at $200 & $400) and high international data usage suspensions (at $500). Root cause has not been established at this moment; IT is still investigating.

For all cases, send details to ICU Case Builder (in Link Center) for tracking and ticketing until we have a root cause and resolution established.
Scenario 1:  Customer with unlimited rate plan which includes Mexico and Canada is in Mexico or Canada and getting DUCs notifications that they are using PPU international data, and possibly even getting suspended for high international data usage.
Check the active features on the line of service. If a customer has an unlimited rate plan, ensure that Roam Like Home bundled features are active.
If RLH features are present and usage in CAN/MEX is being treated as PPU:
1. 	Remove EXUS if the line has been suspended.
2. 	Add SOC EDRCRU to avoid further DUCs notifications and suspensions.
3. 	Create a commitment to check the account before the end of the bill cycle to ensure that the rate plan rerated the CAN/MEX data and that there are no international roaming charges for that CAN/MEX usage.
4. 	If the account reaches the end of the bill cycle and a rerate has not occurred yet, adjust the roaming data usage so that the customer will not be charged when the bill is created.

If no RLH features are found and usage in CAN/MEX is being treated as PPU:
1. 	If the rate plan does not include CAN/MEX roaming, educate the customer about current rate plans that include CAN/MEX. (Legacy Mobile Share plans under 10GB, wearables and connected car lines of service do not qualify for CAN/MEX roaming)
2. 	If the line of service had the Roam North America SOC previously, it may have been removed due to a 5G automatic update. If the account notes indicate that the 5G automatic update has been done, add the Roam North America SOC back to the line (IRRLHCNMX).

Scenario 2:  Customer with active International Day Pass or Passport plan on their line is outside of US/CAN/MEX and getting DUCs notifications that they are using PPU international data, and possibly even getting suspended for high international data usage.
Check to make sure the destination is included in International Day Pass (IDP)/Passport/Passport Pro. If not, educate the customer that usage outside of the IDP/Passport coverage is charged at PPU rates.
Check the effective date of the IDP for Business or Passport/Passport Pro SOC.
If the effective date of the SOC was backdated to cover roaming that has already occurred, the PPU usage will be rerated when Enabler catches up to the transaction. (you should be able to see account notes indicating that the SOC was added and backdated)
1. 	If the customer is still traveling outside the US, remove EXUS if the line has been suspended.
2. 	If the customer is back in the US, go to steps 3 and 4 below.

If the SOC was effective real time and usage is rating as PPU international data:
1. 	Remove EXUS if the line has been suspended.
2. 	Add SOC EDRCRU to avoid further DUCs notifications and suspensions
3. 	Create a commitment to check the account before the end of the bill cycle to ensure that the IDP & Passport/Passport Pro rerated the international data.
4. 	If the account reaches the end of the bill cycle and a rerate has not occurred yet, adjust the roaming data usage according to the international SOC that is on the account so that the customer will not be charged PPU rates when the bill is created.

For IDP, adjust the data charges at the rate of $10 per day.
For Passport/Passport Pro, adjust the data charges as if they used their data allowance and overage.",New Data usage Control System (DUCs) Notification & Suspension Issue - BCSS.html,

10342,How do I explain the PPU address requirements to customers?,"To comply with the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act (MTSA) of 2000, the company is required to capture and maintain a Place of Primary Use (PPU) address for all our customers. This policy provides information on PPU.
Business Rules
Telecommunications providers must obtain a PPU address for mobile devices.
The PPU does not refer to where the phone is used, but rather where the service activated; therefore, the mobile address must be within the service/market area.
The billing address can be any location, in or out of the market.
The PPU must be a valid residence or business street (physical) address and can include rural route and domestic military addresses.
Post office box address for PPU is not available.
Address designators (for example, apartment numbers, floor numbers, suites) are not required for PPU. If these designators drop off during address validation, the PPU address is still considered valid and can be accepted.
MTSA
Congress enacted the MTSA and signed it into federal law in August 2000. It became effective August 1, 2001. This law helps simplify state and local taxation of charges related to your wireless device.
PPU
PPU is defined as a valid street (physical) address within the defined licensed service area for the customer's home market. Use this address for taxation purposes only, not to determine if a customer can have an out of market secondary/additional line.
Contoso Signature Program subscribers should use their residential address, which should be the same as their billing address.
Exceptions to this rule might include children of the account holder enrolled in college. In this instance, we would need the corresponding address within the market we are activating service.
Remind the customer that their rate plan terms may require that at least 50% of their usage must be on a company-owned network.
Allow CRU subscribers attached to a FAN to reference their residential or business address (employer) when activating service.
PPU Address Validation
To verify if the PPU address provided qualifies the customer for service, enter the PPU ZIP code into GEARS located in Link Center:
If the system provides a list of possible usage areas, the customer is eligible for service on the Contoso network.
If no results are returned, the customer is located outside the Contoso Mobility service area and is not eligible for service.",Place of Primary Use (PPU).html,

10326,Can I use the mute button while working on a resolution?,"When you need to place a customer on hold, remain on the line working in silence or utilize the mute button. Only use the mute button if experiencing excessive background noise. Working in silence and use of the mute button includes, but is not limited to, researching the account/issue, accessing myCSP, or completing a transaction.
Note: Do not use the term Silent Hold with the customer. This may give the customer a negative perception of being placed on hold (or multiple holds) while we research and/or complete their request.

The only time to place a customer on an actual hold is when needing to speak to another person/department, transfers, or test calls (e.g., resolution specialist, team manager, or another department).

The following must occur while working in silence or utilizing the mute button:

Basic Expectations: Provide the customer a basic expectation when working in silence or using the mute button:
Since you are not using the hold button, you do not need to set an exact time frame for the wait.
However, provide an approximation and check back in with the customer every two minutes to ensure a positive customer experience.
Advise the Customer: The customer is advised you will be working on their request silently:
Use mute when experiencing excessive noise in your direct area (e.g., tailgate or meeting).
Advise Availability: Advise that you are available if they have any questions:
Avoid the opportunity for the customer to wonder what is going on during the call and have to ask are you still there or hello.
Always keep the customer informed on what you are working on to complete their request.
Acknowledgment from the Customer: The customer has acknowledged they are fine with waiting on the line:
Suggested verbiage: I would like to take some time to research this for you. Is it OK if I work silently/place you on mute while I do this? The customer has the opportunity to say yes or no. Thanks, you will hear silence, but I am here if you need anything.
Acknowledge Appreciation: Once your research or transaction is complete, acknowledge your appreciation for the customer's wait. You do not need to do this if you have a simple question to ask them to aid you in your research or completion of the transaction.
